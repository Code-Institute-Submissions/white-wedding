# White Wedding

Thinking of becoming a wedding planner?

Your search of a brand new website is over. Here is everything you need for your business to get a flying start!

## UX

This is a website for a wedding planner, built because I have a friend who is starting up her own business in this very occupation. The thought is that the site should represent her and others who want to sell the concept of happily ever after through big, beautiful pictures and clean, white design.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Explanation for non-existant Git push in the start of the project

I had misunderstood and thought it was enough to git commit after a few changes. Thankfully, my mentor explained that I had to push it out as well, for my progress to be properly seen. This happened when most of my navigation bar was done. Just thought I would give some heads up.

## Features

We have a logo up in the right corner and a navigation bar in the top right. We also have a footer with social media-links in the bottom. These three features are permanent and can be seen on each page on the website. The navbar and logo have transparent backgrounds and are featured on top of the main page background.


In total we have four different pages on this site:
index.html acts as the home page. It is supposed to lure potential customers in by being clean and inviting. It also has quotes from previous, happy customers which are responsive and can be seen on any platform.
gallery.html has a collage of happy wedding pictures to get potential customers fired up.
about.html provides information about the wedding planner and his/her background. Why he/she is the perfect person for the job. It also features a timeline with important events in the planner's own life. You know, for a personal touch.
contact.html will give potential customers or collaborators the chance to contact the wedding planner with a form, where you can put in information about the upcoming wedding itself.

### Existing Features

- Feature 1 - Navigation through the four pages. The navigation bar lets users navigate freely between the four pages and shows which is currently active through highlighting.
- Feature 2 - The items on the navbar all have an active class which shines brighter when you are on the page in question, as a navigation help.
- Feature 3 - The navbar collapses when featured on a smaller, cellphonesque screen.
- Feature 4 - The footer navigates to social media links outside of the webpage. They open in a new tab.
- Feature 5 - The main background images on each site zooms in just ever so slightly when you arrive at each page, just to give a more slick look.
- Feature 6 - All pages have a slightly dark overlay, to contrast the photos against the bright-coloured logo and navbar.
- Feature 7 - 
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

When we learn back end and gets further into the course, I naturally want to develop this site so we can have the possibility of actually sending messages to the planner and hooking it up to an email of his/her choosing.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [HTML] This project uses HTML as its base language.
- [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com) This project uses Bootstrap for default styling.
- [JavaScript/jQuery] Calm down. I'm not that advanced yet. But to manage to get some responsive bits working, I added the jQuery-links from Bootstrap components' start page.
- [CSS] This project uses CSS for bits that require personal styling, overwriting the more conventional Bootstrap styles.
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) This project uses Font Awesome to provide some extra glow with cool, free icons.
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com) This project uses three fonts (Great Vibes, Raleway & Roboto) found on the Google Fonts website.
- [Google Image Search](https://google.com) All images are from Google and are of the kind which are allowed to be used and altered. I don't want no copyright infringement problems here, y'all.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
   1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
   2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
   3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
   4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

## Credits

Inspiration from the navigation bar came from the Whiskey Drop-project. That is also where I found the idea to use a full-width background picture with an opaque overlay for the home page. Inspo for the footer came from the Love Running-project.

### Content

- The text for section Y was copied from the [Wikipedia article Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z)

### Media

- The photos used in this site were obtained from Google, searching for ... I only chose photos that I was allowed to use. Naturally these photos should be replaced by more personal photos if this website ever becomes used by an actual wedding planner.

### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from my friend Madeleine, who is training to become a wedding planner. Workwise, my inspiration came from earlier projects made with you at the Code Institute.
- Throughout my project, I have researched by visiting other wedding planning websites, to find inspiration.
